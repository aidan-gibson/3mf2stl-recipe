`conda build . --channel conda-forge`
`conda install <path>`

only works for apple silicon and definitely sucks and could be better but I do not care; never attempting a non-python conda package again.


...if I DO try making C++ programs w conda again tho, just look at some examples like https://github.com/psi4/psi4meta/blob/master/conda-recipes/dftd3/meta.yaml
